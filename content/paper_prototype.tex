\section{Paper Prototype}
\label{sec:PAPER_PROTOTYPE}


Our first prototype 
Paper Prototyping
on A3 cardboard
time-saving
usability testing
testing our ideas
testing graphical interface and interaction/usability, (crucial, since we wanna improve workflow)
testing design 

python-like programming language, with global syntax highlighting (embedded sql as well)

Looks like a code editor
with 3 panels

description:
small red arrow indicates selected context
Green post it stripes indicate current control flow
small red square next to context name indicate
Green cursor in the sourceCode

if one places cursor on a table name inside an SQL query


We want to be able to edit the code as well, we focused in our prototype on data inspection, navigation and modification

We had post it overlays with empty tables, too long tables, single rows that could be appended

But not all wanted to edit the data directly... feels possibly strange, ... too new





usage scenario:
  They have code with some problems.
  Red Squares indicate problems in contexts
  too big data
  change had impact on another
  future
