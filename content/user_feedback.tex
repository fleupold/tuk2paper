>>>> BP1:
Bachelor Project HP1 - In-Memory Data Management for Enhanced ERP


feedback: popups are nice, but occlude the code
Even movable and pinnable popups -> cluttered workspace -> inferior user interface
-> Fixed (resizing) area for data results and statistics 

feedback: Some preffered using keyboard over mouse, should be accessible via keyboard shortcuts


feedback: Screen estate: some mentioned, it is fixed, so panel could be completely on another screen

>>>> BP2:
Bachelor Project: Real-time Analysis of Genome Data

feedback: hard to grasp what a data context represents

feedback: They liked the idea of seing immediate when they change warning/hints at the context panel


feedback: They like the test-case-always-easily-accessible


>>>> General feedback during the week:

general feedback: on the contrary some said, it should be as tangibel as possible,
easy navigable as today mobile and table applications

feedback: What, if context list is getting larger? Search?

feedback: What if I select only partial queries?
