\section{Design Thinking}
\label{sec:DESIGN_THINKING}

Design thinking refers to the method of finding an innovative solution to an abstract or ill-defined problem. It attempts to structure the ideation process and give guidelines, methodologies and framework that help in problem forming, -solving and -design. Design thinking is a human-centered approach with multidisciplinary collaboration and iterative improvements to produce innovative products, system and service \cite{design_thinking_book}. There are various interpretations and definitions of design thinking. We refer to design thinking as defined by the Hasso Plattner Institue of Design at Stanford and Potsdam. In this definition the design thinking process contains of six different phases, which are pictured in Figure \ref{fig:design_thinking_process}. The process is not linear, which is indicated by the connections amongst different non-succeeding phases. Every instance of a design thinking project is different. It is possible to jump back and forth between the different phases. We are going to explain the aim of each phase briefly as the structure of our report reflects the pathway through the phases in the course of our project.

\paragraph{Understand}
In the first phase of the process, the team learns becomes familiar with the problem domain by talking to experts and conducting research. The goal is to develop background knowledge through these experiences. It is the foundation for all further steps. Throughout the process this stage might be visited again as new areas of problems, ideas or solutions emerge.

\paragraph{Observe}
What people say does not always correspond to their actual feelings, thoughts or actions. Therefore, it is necessary to watch how people behave and interact. These observations can be used to talk to users, ask questions and reflect on their behaviors. They lay the foundation for insights which are needed to define a point of view later in the process. Another point of this phase is to develop a kind of empathy for the user.

\paragraph{Point Of View}
The point of view consists of three parts: A persona, which is an . A need that this persona has and that the team is trying to satisfy with its solution and lastly an insight that has been generated from the observation made in the second phase. A commonly used method of defining a point of view is the "How might we..." question, which is a statement in a form "How might we help our persona to satisfy his/her need".
While the phases before tried to capture a wide range of users and problems in this stage the teams settles on a single point from which it can converge again in the ideation phase.

\paragraph{Ideate}
While the first three phases focus on the defining and understanding the problem, the ideate phase opens up the solution space for the previously defined problem. The team is challenges to brainstorm as many possible solutions as possible, while going for quantity, deferring judgment and building on the ideas of others.

\paragraph{Prototype}
Prototyping is a crucial part of the design thinking process. It allows to make the ideas visible and tangible. Quick and cheap prototypes, e.g. using sketches or paper are well suited for conveying the idea and getting feedback. People tend to hesitate to criticize or suggest changes for overly polished prototypes. A key concept is to fail early and often.

\paragraph{Test}
In the test phase the team collects feedback for their ideas which they made experiancable through their prototype. The goal of this phase is to learn which parts of the design work and which don't.
Testing ensures that the product is desirable for the end user and stresses the user focus of design thinking.
Latest from here on the team continues with one of the earlier phases.

\paragraph{}
Each potential solution has to satisfy three requirements as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:desire_viable_feasible}. It has to be desirable, meaning that it satisfies an actual need of the user. It has to be feasible, which means that it should be technically possible to implement the solution. Lastly, it has to be viable for the business partner providing the solution.
Innovative solutions lie in the intersection of the three sets. Design thinking helps to find solutions that lie in this intersection.
